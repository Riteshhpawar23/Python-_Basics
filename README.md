# üêç Python Basics & Advanced Concepts

A complete reference guide covering Python fundamentals, object-oriented programming, advanced topics, and popular libraries. Ideal for beginners and intermediate learners.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction
Python is a high-level, interpreted, dynamically typed language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It supports multiple paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Python Basics
- **Syntax & Variables**: Python uses indentation for code blocks. Variables are dynamically typed.
- **Data Types**: Common types include integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
- **Operators**: Arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, membership, and identity operators.
- **Input/Output**: `input()` for user input and `print()` for output.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Control Flow
- **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control logic.
- **Loops**: `for` and `while` loops for iteration, with optional `else` clauses.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Functions
- Defined using `def` keyword.
- Support for default arguments, variable-length arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`).
- Functions are first-class citizens and can be passed as arguments.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Classes & Objects**: Define blueprints with attributes and methods.
- **Inheritance**: Create subclasses that inherit attributes/methods from parent classes.
- **Encapsulation**: Restrict access to internal object state using private members.
- **Polymorphism**: Different classes can implement the same method differently.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Concepts
- **Lambda Functions**: Anonymous, inline functions.
- **List Comprehensions**: Concise way to create lists.
- **Decorators**: Modify functions or methods dynamically.
- **Generators**: Create iterators using `yield` for memory-efficient looping.
- **Context Managers**: Manage resources using the `with` statement.
